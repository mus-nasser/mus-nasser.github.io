                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project involves the simulation of an auto services garage facility to optimize its operations
                    and enhance service delivery. The simulation was developed using FlexSim to understand and improve
                    how the facility handles different types of vehicles and services, particularly during peak hours.
                </p>
                <p>The project aims to optimize the garage's operational efficiency by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Configuring traffic patterns inside the facility</li>
                    <li>Analyzing operator utilization during peak and regular hours</li>
                    <li>Identifying and mitigating workflow bottlenecks</li>
                    <li>Estimating the time each vehicle spends inside the facility</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>The garage facility faces several operational challenges, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing the flow of vehicles during peak hours</li>
                    <li>Ensuring efficient utilization of operators and service bays</li>
                    <li>Handling various customer types and service requests</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address these challenges, the project simulated different scenarios and configurations within the
                    garage. This included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a system that serves around 24 vehicles simultaneously across different service blocks
                    </li>
                    <li>Configuring special entry points and workflows for clients with specific needs</li>
                    <li>Optimizing the sequence and timing of services based on customer demand and service dependencies
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
                <p>The simulation provided valuable insights into the garage's operations, resulting in several key
                    outcomes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughput: The system's ability to handle vehicles increased significantly, with optimized
                        workflows reducing service times and improving overall customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Operator Utilization: The analysis highlighted the optimal number of operators needed during
                        different times, leading to better resource management.</li>
                    <li>Service Time: The simulation estimated and validated service times for various tasks, helping to
                        set realistic expectations for customers and staff.</li>
                    <li>Bottleneck Identification: Potential bottlenecks were identified and addressed, improving the
                        flow of vehicles through the facility.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The project underscored the importance of detailed planning and simulation in managing complex
                    operations like an auto services garage. By visualizing different scenarios and analyzing their
                    outcomes, the project was able to propose actionable improvements that could significantly enhance
                    the facility's efficiency and customer experience.</p>
