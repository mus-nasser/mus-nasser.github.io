                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on enhancing warehouse order-picking efficiency through the application of
                    Discrete Event Simulation (DES) using FlexSim. It specifically addresses the challenges in
                    optimizing conveyor routing order consolidation methodology to meet the increasing demands of
                    e-commerce, especially during peak sales periods.</p>
                <p>The project aims to create a more efficient and streamlined order-picking process by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing travel distances for pickers</li>
                    <li>Minimizing order processing times</li>
                    <li>Improving resource utilization</li>
                    <li>Enhancing accuracy in order fulfillment</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>The project addresses the complexities of warehouse management in the e-commerce era, which often
                    involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing high SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) volumes</li>
                    <li>Facing stringent fulfillment time requirements</li>
                    <li>Dealing with fluctuating demand patterns</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To tackle these challenges, the project utilizes FlexSim's 3D modeling and process flow features to
                    create a digital twin of the warehouse environment. This simulation model enables the exploration of
                    different order consolidation strategies and conveyor routing configurations to identify the most
                    efficient solutions.</p>
                <p>Specifically, the project focuses on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimizing the placement of product zones to reduce picker travel distances</li>
                    <li>Designing efficient conveyor routing paths to minimize transit times</li>
                    <li>Implementing dynamic order batching to consolidate orders based on proximity and destination
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
                <p>The implementation of DES via FlexSim has yielded significant improvements in various performance
                    metrics, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughput: The simulation model demonstrated a 15% increase in average throughput, from 93
                        orders to 115 orders,
                        indicating a substantial boost in overall productivity.</li>
                    <li>Travel Distance: The optimized conveyor routing and product zone placement led to a 22%
                        reduction in average
                        picker travel distances, saving valuable time and labor costs.</li>
                    <li>Utilization: Picker utilization rates improved by 10%, suggesting a more efficient allocation of
                        resources and a
                        reduction in idle time.</li>
                    <li>Order Processing Time: The average order processing time decreased by 18%, resulting in faster
                        fulfillment and
                        potentially improved customer satisfaction.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/SoI throughput.png" alt="Warehouse Throughput" /></span>

                <p>The analysis of throughput data over time revealed key insights, such as variations in performance
                    and potential
                    trends that can be further explored for optimization. Moreover, the utilization analysis highlighted
                    the importance
                    of efficient task allocation and potential areas for improvement. The travel distance analysis
                    demonstrated the
                    impact of layout and process changes on operator efficiency, suggesting opportunities for further
                    optimization
                    through layout modifications or automation.</p>
